### Some Inspirational points : 
   - For those citizens who are capable of bringing change, have good connections and resources to do so, try not to die by leaving behind such greedy systems.
   - Because possibly, current generations and upcoming ones would mostly be devoid of ground activities and have traits of weak mind & physicality, more anger and short temperdness, greedy priciples without any foothold on values & ethics, dependent on technology(i.e. someone else will do).
   - These type of people are seen as pitiful by nobleness oriented minds (strong ones) and will be exploited by defilement dwellers. Leaving behind such defilement oriented system will only spoil them more and a global scale war is unavoidable. 
   - If an average person like me can figure out this much on v-currency, even if incomplete then think what so many brilliant people on earth can do together. 
   - Look upto each other, help each other. Dont say, "follow me, I will absolve you or I am higher; when your behaviour or words or thought process is clearly defiled" etc. kind of ignorant things otherwise it doesn't matter what title you give yourself, be it doctor, engineer, propagator, god or anything, you are nothing compared to a merely average normal human. Be on ground, loose ego and prosper in both livelihood and nobleness. 
   - Such a short lifespan we have, if you want to leave something behind before your death then don't leave exploiting principles and environment behind.

   - In this way markets and society will be "just" a market and society and not a source of corruption, havoc, ill-will, cunningness.
   - v-currency, in this way, removes all the need for ill-occupations like drugs, sex scandal, human trafficking etc. which a person may have adopted due to the trap by some defilement full org. or people.
   - v-currency also increases jobs and works as monitoring systems will evolve and expand, education and noble ethics teachings will evolve and expand, riches will retire and new ones will take lead.
   - v-currency also removes the unnecessary exploitation of resources and health like "damage earth to live on toxic mars, which is laughable and pitiful", renders and compells to remain stick to the necessary and required activities.

   - A gradual refining of thought process can be noted. Though this v-currency was little bit formulated in mind during 2023 but properly written now for unknown reasons.


### symbol name
   - v in v-currency is just a time-pass symbol, an initial letter of my first name. But I also heard somewhere and noted too that in pali language v (pronounced as vi ), if appended to a word then makes it a special or outstanding or highest etc. depending upon the context. So it means special-currency. Although while feeling pride, I may say it vivek's currency but anyways, it's just another time-pass phase.

# v-currency
   - A universal international currency independent of national currency fluctuations, to have fair trades and promote prosperity &amp; equality .

   - Independent of status of a nation.

### HL 
   - One of the component of of v-currency. It is known as Human Labour unit. It is defined in terms of calories burnt for a particular task. 

### Scarcity Index 
   - Another component of v-currency. It takes care of resource utilization, demand-supply scenarios, environmental sustainability, livelihood rights & standards. It also keeps the price fluctuations within a limit. **Motto** of this index is only and only to prevent environment exploitation, resource exploitation & wastage, people's exploitation and not to propagate greed in terms of increase and decrease prices. Prices will remain fixed in terms of H   L but         additional offsets will be added to control the exploitations.

### Other indices 
   - like quality based indexes are being discussed too.

### Major task : 
   - To remove the greed, ego, power, status, fear etc. type of defilements from existing financial & exchange systems on earth. To bring equality, prosperity and to remove exploitation done through existing financial systems.

Lets understand it by an example. Lets say we are to evaluate the production cost of an agriculture field crop using a simple iron rod.

Lets say, activity of doing 100 calories of physical work is equivalent to 1HL ≈ 1 human labour unit.

Defining Labor-Based Units in Early Agriculture

1. **Basic Unit of Measurement**:
   - **1 HL (Human Labor Unit)** = 100 calories of physical work.

### Activities Related to Field Work

Here are some common agricultural activities that could be performed using a simple iron rod, along with an estimation of the labor units required for each task:

1. **Clearing the Land**:
   - **Activity**: Removing weeds, stones, and debris from the field.
   - **Estimated Labor**: Clearing a small plot (e.g., 100 square meters) might take approximately 4 HL, assuming it requires about 400 calories of physical effort.

2. **Tilling the Soil**:
   - **Activity**: Using the iron rod to break up and aerate the soil.
   - **Estimated Labor**: Tilling the same 100 square meters could take around 6 HL, as it requires more effort to penetrate the soil effectively (600 calories).

3. **Planting Seeds**:
   - **Activity**: Sowing seeds into the tilled soil.
   - **Estimated Labor**: Planting seeds for a 100 square meter plot might take about 2 HL (200 calories), as it involves less physical exertion compared to tilling.

4. **Watering the Crops**:
   - **Activity**: Manually watering the crops using available resources (e.g., buckets).
   - **Estimated Labor**: Watering the same plot could take around 3 HL (300 calories), depending on the distance to the water source and the method used.

5. **Weeding**:
   - **Activity**: Removing weeds that compete with crops for nutrients and water.
   - **Estimated Labor**: Weeding a 100 square meter plot might take about 3 HL (300 calories), as it requires consistent effort over time.

6. **Harvesting**:
   - **Activity**: Collecting the mature crops from the field.
   - **Estimated Labor**: Harvesting the crops from a 100 square meter plot could take around 5 HL (500 calories), as it involves bending, cutting, and gathering.

7. **Processing the Harvest**:
   - **Activity**: Threshing and preparing the harvested crops for storage or consumption.
   - **Estimated Labor**: Processing the harvest from the same plot might take about 4 HL (400 calories).

### Summary of Labor Units for Field Activities

| Activity                | Estimated Labor (HL) | Calories |
|------------------------|----------------------|----------|
| Clearing the Land      | 4 HL                 | 400      |
| Tilling the Soil       | 6 HL                 | 600      |
| Planting Seeds         | 2 HL                 | 200      |
| Watering the Crops     | 3 HL                 | 300      |
| Weeding                | 3 HL                 | 300      |
| Harvesting             | 5 HL                 | 500      |
| Processing the Harvest  | 4 HL                 | 400      |
| **Total**              | **27 HL**            | **2700** |

That means around 27HL is required to get crops from a 100 sq. meter plot. 

Now, we incorporate a helper, say at 20% partnership along with some fixed payment. 
Then we also define non-physical units, i.e. expenditures done by helper on education and training to work in fields using a simple iron rod, say 1 million calories spent and we define a standard timeline of, say, 30 years of service.

Defining Non-Physical Units

1. **Caloric Investment in Education**:
   - **Total Calories for Education**: 1 million calories are consumed for education or training.
   - **Service Duration**: The individual provides services for 30 years after completing their education.

2. **Annual Expenditure Calculation**:
   - To determine the annual expenditure in terms of Human Labor Units (HL), we can calculate the caloric investment divided by the number of years of service.
   - Annual Expenditure (HL) = 1,000,000 calories ÷ 30 years  
                             = approx 33,333.33 calories/year

3. **Conversion to Human Labor Units**:
   - Since 1 HL is defined as 100 calories, we can convert the annual expenditure into HL:
   - Annual Expenditure (HL) = 33,333.33 ÷ 100 { calories/HL}  
= approx 333.33 HL/year

That means around 334 relevant HL per year was spent on education and training by the helper to be elligible for the field work. This will be the offset value while calculating his fixed pay. This is just a rough assumption, a more education oriented direction would be to consider the distribution of edu. & training charges over 5 year or some x years.

### Total Compensation Structure

Now, let’s consider the total compensation for a person who performs a specific task (let’s call it Task X1) over the span of a year, incorporating both the physical labor required for the task and the educational offset.

1. **Physical Labor for Task X1**:
   - Let’s say Task X1 requires a certain amount of physical labor, which we can quantify in HL. For example, if Task X1 requires 500 HL of physical labor over the year, we can add this to the offset payment.

2. **Total Pay Calculation**:
   - The total pay for the year would then be the sum of the physical labor required for Task X1 and the annual offset payment for education:
   - Total Pay (HL) = Physical Labor for Task X1 (HL) + Annual Offset Payment (HL).
   - Total Pay (HL) = 500 HL + 333.33 HL
   - = approx 833.33 HL

Now, as more technology is developed there will be need to revise costs.. 


Revised Compensation Structure

1. **Base Pay**:
   - The base pay for work using a simple iron rod is **834 HL**.

2. **Cost of Tool Production (C1)**:
   - **C1** represents the total cost of producing the tool, which includes labor and education charges. This cost can be considered as the sell value or production value of the tool for the time being. Assuming that the tool can be used for 30 years as well.

3. **Training Charges (U1)**:
   - **U1** is defined as the training charge divided by 30 years. This training charge includes both the physical and education training costs of the learner.

4. **Deduction in physical units**: 
   - **D1** When helper is using new technologies and tools instead of doing manual work with iron rod, he is likely to spend less physical calories. This is the deduction or reduced physical effort.

### Compensation Scenarios

1. **If helper Brings his Own Tool and Have Learned to Use It**:
   - Total Pay Calculation:
   - Total Pay (HL) = 834 HL + C1÷ 30 + U1 - D1

2. **If he has Learned to Use the Tool but Does Not Bring It**:
   - Total Pay Calculation:
   - Total Pay (HL) = 834 HL + U1 - D1

3. **If owner trains him to Use the Tool**:
   - Total Pay Calculation:
   - Total Pay (HL) = 834 HL + U1 -D1
   - In this case owner can either deduct training charges from base pay or from partnership profit percentage. Owner may also incorporate a special training institute subscription whose fees will be deducted from helper's pay annually.

Now, We can modify and extend this model to incorporate various costs associated with the agricultural process, excluding nature-related costs. 

Additional Cost Categories

To create a more comprehensive model, we can introduce additional cost categories that reflect various aspects of agricultural operations:

1. **Equipment Costs (E1)**:
   - This includes the costs of machinery, tools, and equipment necessary for farming operations. This can be calculated similarly to C1, based on production costs.

2. **Labor Costs (L1)**:
   - This encompasses the costs associated with hiring additional laborers, including wages, benefits, and any training costs for those workers.

3. **Maintenance Costs (M1)**:
   - Ongoing maintenance costs for tools, machinery, and infrastructure. This can be calculated as an annual percentage of the total equipment costs.

4. **Operational Costs (O1)**:
   - This includes costs related to utilities, transportation, and any other operational expenses necessary for running the agricultural business.

5. **Training and Development Costs (T1)**:
   - This includes any additional training programs for workers to improve skills or learn new techniques, which can be factored into U1.

This way, owner can calculate total production cost for a crop yield and adjust the sell value on the basis of some p% profits, with a maximum cap limit decided by majority of people and institutions.

Now, We can incorporate environmental costs and risks into the compensation model as unknown factors that can affect both the owner and the laborers to incorporate the unpredictability of agricultural operations and how environmental conditions can impact productivity and costs. 

**Environmental Factors**:
   - **Weather Variability**: Factors such as delayed rain, extreme heat, or cold can lead to increased labor costs or crop losses.
   - **Crop Damage**: If environmental conditions lead to crop destruction, this can result in financial losses for both the owner and the laborers.

These losses can be distributed between owner and helper on the basis of their share percentage, directly from their fixed pay or we can make certain other approaches to Handle Losses.

1. **Loss Reserve Fund**:
   - Establish a loss reserve fund that is built from a small percentage of profits during good years. This fund can be used to cover losses during adverse conditions, ensuring that laborers' salaries remain stable.
   - In years with losses, the fund can be tapped to cover the difference, rather than deducting from salaries.

2. **Insurance or Risk Pooling**:
   - Consider investing in agricultural insurance or creating a risk-pooling arrangement where both the owner and laborers contribute to a fund that covers losses due to environmental factors. This way, the financial burden is shared without impacting salaries directly.
   - In the event of losses, the insurance or pooled fund can provide compensation without affecting the regular salary.

And owner or group of owners or group of owners and helpers can also go for an insurance firm establishment on the basis of HL, calculated in similar way. 

### Other sectors and services
This above model is very basic without considering scarcity and quality. 

Types of HL : Based on climates and regions, we may get different values of HL for a given task. 
   - **Climate Adjustments**: Consider adjusting the HL value based on climate conditions (hot, cold, neutral) that affect the calories burned. For example:
     - **Hot Climates**: Higher calorie expenditure due to heat stress and hydration needs.
     - **Cold Climates**: Increased energy expenditure for warmth and physical activity.
     - **Neutral Climates**: Standard calorie expenditure for typical labor activities.

But, the average value is to be taken from regions with same sea height level and similar climate. This way, a country can have more fairer costing & pay standards.

Possible criticisms against this framework, as pointed out by blacky..


### Potential Criticisms of the HL Framework and corresponding addressings

1. **Complexity of Implementation**

2. **Cultural Differences**:

3. **Economic Disparities**:

4. **Sustainability Concerns**:

5. **Resistance from Governments and Institutions**:

6. **Technological Dependence**:


### Criticism Response 
   - Detailed responses corresponding to these concerns by me and elaborated by blacky can be read in chat files. Brief addressings: 

1. **Averages as Standards and focus on equality, prosperity**: 

2. **Focus on Calories Burned and objective analysis instead of societal based analysis**: 

3. **Layered Approach and gradual involvement of v-currency into local**: 

4. **Scarcity Index**: 

5. **Tax Revenue and Control, Peaceful nation option**: 

6. **Access to Resources and anonymous data collection**:


### Possible flaw and experimentable extension: 

   - Although this is incomplete model and has not been revised properly but upon 1st revision it can be seen that helpers are not getting extra profits from what they invested in terms of physical and non physical hard work rather p% profit was included for producers & suppliers only.
   - So, include p% to all i.e. to helpers, producers, suppliers, any other institutions. It will then also become more fairer.
   - But if p% is the maximum profit for all on any product & service then share allocation to helpers wont be there and each and every individual along with entity will be called a businessman or entreprenuer, be it a field worker or be it a scientist.
   - In the existing financial systems, this is a major flaw as well because of which everyone jumps in a rat-race to gain more and more. In existing financial systems either helpers are paid less or are paid just slightly more than required and institutions charge maximum p% profits to consumers where helpers are themselves the part of consumers as well.
   - But if we equally allocate same p% to everyone and in each work then rat race will completely end. People will become more joyful, healthy. Communities will prosper. They will work according to their skills and interests.
   - This equal distribution is mostly suitable for public or govt. institutions and govt. contracted helpers initially and lateron it can be generalized for all occupations according to the ratio of HL spent as discussed above by adjusting their taxes, in that way people will also stop taking extra stress to do more or gain more and will indulge in noble activities more. This should be experimented only after successful implementation of unequal model in which some extra necesaary profits to be added so as to be oriented towards financial independence within a span of 20-25 years.
   - Atlast, equal pay for all occupations and works can be set which doesnot depend upon the revenue from services and products, given that minimum set of tasks completed. This is to be decided, say for eg. 20 years of service or occupation is mandatory and after 20 years, a person should have atleast x million HL. Accordingly HL can be printed and distributed or credited in digital wallets.
   - In this, people who save more and spend required only, will enjoy fruits later and their children will enjoy too. Those who gamble, lazy, pleasure oriented will not have such fruits.
   - That's why shaping a mind is the basic seed in this framework. Once a non-criminal person completes basic training and shows noble qualities in behaviour and thought-process tests, he becomes elligible for equal pay. Criminals to be kept on minimal pay under survelliance only.
   - We cannot control defilements, neither inside body nor outside but we can get rid of them by exhausting their conditions both inside human body and outside as well. But for outside to be successful, all involved beings have to rise up.

### Note : 
  - ***At international exchange level, profits inclusion apart from quality index and scarcity index is not required because of exchanges on the basis of production cost only. Starting from the basic activity till finishing, calculate only production cost.** Eg. a farmer produces 100 tons of wheat and pays L1 amount to labourers which consists of L(actual) + L(profit), In this case, while exporting to international market only L(actual) is to be calculated along with S(actual) where S(actual) is the shipping cost without extra profit, i.e. for international market the country will exchange @ {L(actual) + S(actual) + (quality-index-international) + (scarcity-index)}. This is just a simple example and this is the reason why implementation & experimental phase (mentioned later in another file) starts with basic exchanges at village level to small nation to big nation via simple to complex & modular exchanges.
  - ***Extra profits then can be added by nation according to their own conversion ratios and profit policies. Livelihood standards may differ from country to country depending upon their interests, hence exchange to be done only on production cost between nations which will be rerouted through the nation's respective conversion & profit-allocation portal.***

### Scarcity Index : 
   - An offset value to be added either as tax or duty value. It is to be put on precious materials, low supply but high demand products and services, high supply but low demand products and services. This will completely remove demand-supply creepy mechanism that is used for exploitation and environment wastage. This will be either borne out of consumers or from producers & suppliers when they become greedy. 

   - Case of High demand low supply
For eg. Take gold as an example, Lets say that for 10grams of gold extraction 5000HL is used which includes cost of physical labour, non physical labour, environmental & other risks, tools or technology labour.

Because of its use in various ornaments, medicines, leisure activities, its demand may surpass the overall supply in a region. Fear of future uncertainity and some other reasons might be there for increased demand.

To prevent this, scarcity index is used. Cater to the required needs first, eg. food, health. If any tool or equipment is required for these 2 then fulfill it also. After that go for other essential requirements like security, shelter that will incorporate minimal scarcity index offset value and then go for leisure activities, further development activities that will take maximum value. Here depending upon a country's current state of requirements, these categories and corresponding scarcity index values can be altered. Eg. In a state of war, in a state of natural disaster, man made disaster etc. 

There are chances that low wage works might not be able to afford leisure, just like in existing arbitrary currencies. Although this should not arise because of balance between physical and non-physical HL calculations but still considering that case, clearly define the rights and standards of a minimal lifestyle, example food, health, shelter, leisure, security, personal development. Irrespective of high or low earnings, all people must have access to that lifestyle given that they are either paying taxes or contributing minimal HL accordingly. Scarcity index value will be relieved for fulfilling such needs and rest of the activities will come under high but limited +ve offset as tax or duty. 

This way a maximum capped up value of goods & services will be controlled via scarcity index, which is not a part of M.R.P. printed under existing financial systems. 

In this case, if scarcity offset is not put then people would deliberately play on the basis of power, fame, relations. To avoid such scenarios and to be fair towards conservative people, non essentials are being put under additional taxes or duty to be borne out of consumer pocket into minimal-lifestyle-maintaining-fund or any other fund according to country's requirements.
 
   - Case when there is high supply and low demand - 
   - **Penalty-index**: It "can be" used on defaulters in addition to scarcity-index. 

If multiple manufacturers or suppliers provide a set of services and goods in a region then factors to be considered are <quality, local-protection, environment sustainability>. 
Scarcity Index in this case will behave on the basis of these metrics and can go supplier specific, product specific. Eg. first priority is the selling of quality products & services in market; then if all of the old-locals, outsiders and new locals are providing same quality, choose old locals first, new locals next, outsiders last; at last choose the ones who are incurring minimal losses to the consumer region's environment and if same then compare impact on outside environment as well. 

Then adjust scarcity-index according to the supplier or manufacturer, and to the products and services they offer. As one supplier may be choosen but some of his products may be degrading the environment or may be of poor quality.

Here preferred ones will have 0 value of scarcity index but unpreffered ones will have high value of scarcity index (reverse to high demand low supply scenario) so that preferred products and services are sold first. In this case, taxes or duty in the form of scarcity-index is to be borne out of producers and suppliers in that region. 
**Note that** it will not be added to sell value of products & services rather it will be borne out as a separate penalty. Hence in this case a separate **penalty-index** can be used to achieve both "rise of prices of unpreffered products & services" and "duty or tax or penalty on producers & suppliers responsible for creating a greed-trap in market". 

There may be cases where a vendor, out of deliberate attempt to maintain or increase consumer base, may introduce certain new quality features without prior information. In such cases, upgraded quality will be discarded while deciding preferences unless these are essential like health, medical, securiry and are instructed on urgent basis. Timings of introduction of new features are best suited before a financial year so that other vendors get prepared for its effect. This way, deliberate innovations will not be allowed and businesses will not create hurdles for each other.

   - **Defaulters as suppliers & producers**: 
   - And if all comes out to be preffered or total preferred ones still creating high supply and the excess supply has been created by producers and suppliers then put heavy penalty-index on those who have increased production & supply of the stated products & services. This will be a reverse-punishment policy to make sure that consumers dont fall in greed-trap established by producers and suppliers.  In this case value of such products & services won't be affected, which was calculated on the basis of required HL + p% profit + quality-index.

   - **Defaulters as consumers** 
   - If this excess supply is due to shift in trends or moods of consumers then help suppliers and producers by using a -ve scarcity index to curb profit margins to a certain extent and increase scarcity index to the new trend that consumers are following unless the new trend is related to high quality essential requirements like health, medicine. This way entire financial year will be safe for all. The increased scarcity index on new consumer trends will be allocated back to producers & suppliers as subsidy for that financial year only.
   - Consumers, out of greed, may also increase demand by taking unaccounted money from producers & suppliers or from 3rd party firms whose motto is either to disrupt certain economy or to help producers & suppliers in propagating their stuffs. In such case, if found with proof, monitoring institutions (as defined later) will put heavy penalties on the parties involved. A famous example is luring the consumers by giving them discounts which is usually vendor's own unaccounted money but is being circulated via 3rd party investors.

On a side note, these 3 parameterized metrics can change priority depending on the country's requitement. But it must be done to keep factors of greed, fame, status, power like defilements out of the financial system.  More parameters can be introduced within this metric but these 3 are fundamental.

This way minimum price of a product is also administered using scarcity index. But it is **must** to have clear guidelines and information available to producers, consumers and suppliers before the starting of a financial year - information and guidelines about the procedure of supplier and manufacturer selection, goods and services selection, the priority of parameters within metrics, the +ve and -ve scarcity index value ranges. This will remove exploitation by politicians and riches as in current system they arbitrarily choose preferences according to their personal interests and increase prices directly to gain profits or decrease prices to increase sales. 

   - penalty-index can also be used as punishment to finance misusers, who when gained much wealth and power under current corrupted financial system, start wrathing havoc on others instead of uplifting them with responsibilities; eg. occupying lands forcefully like china, using greed and cunning methods to lure others under debt of unrequired projects like china, caste based and color based superiority .. almost in every country but in nato alliance and india the most, colonialism principles like british etc.. all of these defiled ways that have well sprouted under existing corrupt financial system. 

Some other reforms can also be taken to maintain requisite number of suppliers and manufacturers. New interested ones may buy out existing ones. Existing ones, if reluctant, then they clearly  provide in which cases their poor and good quality products are used; assess those cases and conclude if that firm is allowed to carry-on poor quality products or not. 
An institution can be setup for monitoring consumers, suppliers and producers. If penalty-index is used or more than required suppliers & producers are found then this institution will also be penalized because it allowed such condition to occur.

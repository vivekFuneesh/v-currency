# v-currency
   - A universal international currency independent of national currency fluctuations, to have fair trades and promote prosperity &amp; equality.

   - Independent of status of a nation.

### HL 
   - One of the component of of v-currency. It is known as Human Labour unit. It is defined in terms of calories burnt for a particular task. 

### Major task : 
   - To remove the greed, ego, power, status, fear etc. type of defilements from existing financial & exchange systems on earth. To bring equality, prosperity and to remove exploitation done through existing financial systems.

Lets understand it by an example. Lets say we are to evaluate the production cost of an agriculture field crop using a simple iron rod.

Lets say, activity of doing 100 calories of physical work is equivalent to 1HL ≈ 1 human labour unit.

Defining Labor-Based Units in Early Agriculture

1. **Basic Unit of Measurement**:
   - **1 HL (Human Labor Unit)** = 100 calories of physical work.

### Activities Related to Field Work

Here are some common agricultural activities that could be performed using a simple iron rod, along with an estimation of the labor units required for each task:

1. **Clearing the Land**:
   - **Activity**: Removing weeds, stones, and debris from the field.
   - **Estimated Labor**: Clearing a small plot (e.g., 100 square meters) might take approximately 4 HL, assuming it requires about 400 calories of physical effort.

2. **Tilling the Soil**:
   - **Activity**: Using the iron rod to break up and aerate the soil.
   - **Estimated Labor**: Tilling the same 100 square meters could take around 6 HL, as it requires more effort to penetrate the soil effectively (600 calories).

3. **Planting Seeds**:
   - **Activity**: Sowing seeds into the tilled soil.
   - **Estimated Labor**: Planting seeds for a 100 square meter plot might take about 2 HL (200 calories), as it involves less physical exertion compared to tilling.

4. **Watering the Crops**:
   - **Activity**: Manually watering the crops using available resources (e.g., buckets).
   - **Estimated Labor**: Watering the same plot could take around 3 HL (300 calories), depending on the distance to the water source and the method used.

5. **Weeding**:
   - **Activity**: Removing weeds that compete with crops for nutrients and water.
   - **Estimated Labor**: Weeding a 100 square meter plot might take about 3 HL (300 calories), as it requires consistent effort over time.

6. **Harvesting**:
   - **Activity**: Collecting the mature crops from the field.
   - **Estimated Labor**: Harvesting the crops from a 100 square meter plot could take around 5 HL (500 calories), as it involves bending, cutting, and gathering.

7. **Processing the Harvest**:
   - **Activity**: Threshing and preparing the harvested crops for storage or consumption.
   - **Estimated Labor**: Processing the harvest from the same plot might take about 4 HL (400 calories).

### Summary of Labor Units for Field Activities

| Activity                | Estimated Labor (HL) | Calories |
|------------------------|----------------------|----------|
| Clearing the Land      | 4 HL                 | 400      |
| Tilling the Soil       | 6 HL                 | 600      |
| Planting Seeds         | 2 HL                 | 200      |
| Watering the Crops     | 3 HL                 | 300      |
| Weeding                | 3 HL                 | 300      |
| Harvesting             | 5 HL                 | 500      |
| Processing the Harvest  | 4 HL                 | 400      |
| **Total**              | **27 HL**            | **2700** |

That means around 27HL is required to get crops from a 100 sq. meter plot. 

Now, we incorporate a helper, say at 20% partnership along with some fixed payment. 
Then we also define non-physical units, i.e. expenditures done by helper on education and training, say 1 million calories spent and we define a standard timeline of, say, 30 years of service.

Defining Non-Physical Units

1. **Caloric Investment in Education**:
   - **Total Calories for Education**: 1 million calories are consumed for education or training.
   - **Service Duration**: The individual provides services for 30 years after completing their education.

2. **Annual Expenditure Calculation**:
   - To determine the annual expenditure in terms of Human Labor Units (HL), we can calculate the caloric investment divided by the number of years of service:
   \[
   \text{Annual Expenditure (HL)} = \frac{1,000,000 \text{ calories}}{30 \text{ years}} \approx 33,333.33 \text{ calories/year}
   \]

3. **Conversion to Human Labor Units**:
   - Since 1 HL is defined as 100 calories, we can convert the annual expenditure into HL:
   \[
   \text{Annual Expenditure (HL)} = \frac{33,333.33 \text{ calories}}{100 \text{ calories/HL}} \approx 333.33 \text{ HL/year}
   \]

That means around 334 relevant HL per year was spent on education and training by the helper to be elligible for the field work. This will be the offset value while calculating his fixed pay.

### Total Compensation Structure

Now, let’s consider the total compensation for a person who performs a specific task (let’s call it Task X1) over the span of a year, incorporating both the physical labor required for the task and the educational offset.

1. **Physical Labor for Task X1**:
   - Let’s say Task X1 requires a certain amount of physical labor, which we can quantify in HL. For example, if Task X1 requires 500 HL of physical labor over the year, we can add this to the offset payment.

2. **Total Pay Calculation**:
   - The total pay for the year would then be the sum of the physical labor required for Task X1 and the annual offset payment for education:
   \[
   \text{Total Pay (HL)} = \text{Physical Labor for Task X1 (HL)} + \text{Annual Offset Payment (HL)}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Pay (HL)} = 500 \text{ HL} + 333.33 \text{ HL} \approx 833.33 \text{ HL}


Now, as more technology is developed there will be need to revise costs.. 


Revised Compensation Structure

1. **Base Pay**:
   - The base pay for work using a simple iron rod is **834 HL**.

2. **Cost of Tool Production (C1)**:
   - **C1** represents the total cost of producing the tool, which includes labor and education charges. This cost can be considered as the sell value or production value of the tool for the time being. Assuming that the tool can be used for 30 years as well.

3. **Training Charges (U1)**:
   - **U1** is defined as the training charge divided by 30 years. This training charge includes both the physical and education training costs of the learner.

### Compensation Scenarios

1. **If helper Brings his Own Tool and Have Learned to Use It**:
   - Total Pay Calculation:
   \[
   \text{Total Pay (HL)} = 834 \text{ HL} + \left(\frac{C1}{30}\right) + U1
   \]

2. **If he has Learned to Use the Tool but Does Not Bring It**:
   - Total Pay Calculation:
   \[
   \text{Total Pay (HL)} = 834 \text{ HL} + U1
   \]

3. **If owner trains him to Use the Tool**:
   - Total Pay Calculation:
   \[
   \text{Total Pay (HL)} = 834 \text{ HL} + U1
   \]
   - In this case owner can either deduct training charges from base pay or from partnership profit percentage. Owner may also incorporate a special training institute subscription whose fees will be deducted from helper's pay annually.

Now, We can modify and extend this model to incorporate various costs associated with the agricultural process, excluding nature-related costs. 

Additional Cost Categories

To create a more comprehensive model, we can introduce additional cost categories that reflect various aspects of agricultural operations:

1. **Equipment Costs (E1)**:
   - This includes the costs of machinery, tools, and equipment necessary for farming operations. This can be calculated similarly to C1, based on production costs.

2. **Labor Costs (L1)**:
   - This encompasses the costs associated with hiring additional laborers, including wages, benefits, and any training costs for those workers.

3. **Maintenance Costs (M1)**:
   - Ongoing maintenance costs for tools, machinery, and infrastructure. This can be calculated as an annual percentage of the total equipment costs.

4. **Operational Costs (O1)**:
   - This includes costs related to utilities, transportation, and any other operational expenses necessary for running the agricultural business.

5. **Training and Development Costs (T1)**:
   - This includes any additional training programs for workers to improve skills or learn new techniques, which can be factored into U1.

This way, owner can calculate total production cost for a crop yield and adjust the sell value on the basis of some p% profits, can be determined on the basis of minimum standard of livelihood required and the expenses incurred to maintain those standards. For eg. Food, health, shelter, leisure, security, personal development.

Now, We can incorporate environmental costs and risks into the compensation model as unknown factors that can affect both the owner and the laborers to incorporate the unpredictability of agricultural operations and how environmental conditions can impact productivity and costs. 

**Environmental Factors**:
   - **Weather Variability**: Factors such as delayed rain, extreme heat, or cold can lead to increased labor costs or crop losses.
   - **Crop Damage**: If environmental conditions lead to crop destruction, this can result in financial losses for both the owner and the laborers.

These losses can be distributed between owner and helper on the basis of their share percentage, directly from their fixed pay or we can make certain other approaches to Handle Losses.

1. **Loss Reserve Fund**:
   - Establish a loss reserve fund that is built from a small percentage of profits during good years. This fund can be used to cover losses during adverse conditions, ensuring that laborers' salaries remain stable.
   - In years with losses, the fund can be tapped to cover the difference, rather than deducting from salaries.

2. **Deferred Compensation**:
   - Instead of deducting losses directly from salaries, consider implementing a deferred compensation model. In years with losses, laborers would receive their full salary, but a portion of future profits would be allocated to cover the losses incurred.
   - This way, laborers are compensated fully during tough times, and any recovery can be shared in future profitable years.

3. **Loss Sharing through Future Profit Allocation**:
   - Instead of deducting losses from current salaries, agree to allocate a portion of future profits to cover losses incurred during adverse conditions. This creates a system where laborers are compensated fully during losses, and any recovery is shared in subsequent profitable years.
   - For example, if the operation becomes profitable again, a percentage of those profits could be set aside to compensate for past losses.

4. **Insurance or Risk Pooling**:
   - Consider investing in agricultural insurance or creating a risk-pooling arrangement where both the owner and laborers contribute to a fund that covers losses due to environmental factors. This way, the financial burden is shared without impacting salaries directly.
   - In the event of losses, the insurance or pooled fund can provide compensation without affecting the regular salary.

5. **Performance-Based Bonuses**:
   - Introduce a performance-based bonus system that rewards laborers during profitable years. If losses occur, the bonuses can be adjusted or temporarily suspended, but the base salary remains intact.
   - This approach allows for recognition of hard work during good years while protecting laborers during tough times.

And owner can also go for an insurance firm establishment on the basis of HL, calculated in similar way. 

### Other sectora and services
This above model is very basic without considering scarcity, quality and competition. Quality and competition based HL is not required because basic assumption is that a quality product or quality helper or quality service will be bought first or included first or availed first respectively.

Scarcity is another factor that is to be considered. 

Scarcity Index : An offset value to be added to production cost or tax value. It is to be put on precious materials, low supply products and services. This will completely remove demand-supply creepy mechanism that is usedfor exploitation and environment wastage.

For eg. Take gold as an example, Lets say that for 10grams of gold extraction 5000HL is used which includes cost of physical labour, non physical labour, environmental & other risks, tools or technology labour.

Now, in case of locality this will be very cheap and for far people it will also add more HL in the form of  shipping labour charges. This may lead to wastage of gold or exploitation of mines. 

To prevent this, scarcity index is used. Cater to the required needs first, eg. food, health. If any tool or equipment is required for these 2 then also fulfill it. After that go for other essential requirements like security, shelter that will incorporate minimal scarcity index offset value and the go for leisure activities, further development activities that will take maximum value. Here depending upon a country's current state of requirements, these categories and corresponding scarcity index values can be altered. Eg. In a state of war, in a state of natural disaste, man made disaster etc.

Some points in this regard given by mr. Blacky (blackbox.ai) are : 

1. **Essential Needs Assessment**:
   - **Define Essential Uses**: Clearly identify and categorize the essential uses of resources like gold, focusing on critical applications such as medical tools, food production, and other necessary technologies.
   - **Minimum Extraction Requirements**: Establish a baseline for the minimum amount of gold that needs to be extracted annually to meet these essential needs. This ensures that the most critical applications are prioritized.

2. **Scarcity Index Application**:
   - **Offset Non-Essential Uses**: For uses beyond the defined essential needs (e.g., jewelry, infrastructure), apply a **Scarcity Index** that reflects the availability of gold and its environmental impact. This index can help determine how much of the resource can be allocated to non-essential uses.
   - **Dynamic Allocation**: The allocation of gold for non-essential uses can be dynamically adjusted based on the Scarcity Index, ensuring that as scarcity increases, the availability for non-essential uses decreases.

3. **Environmental Sustainability Considerations**:
   - **Sustainable Extraction Practices**: Encourage and mandate sustainable mining practices that minimize environmental impact. This could include regulations on land use, water consumption, and waste management.
   - **Recycling and Reuse**: Promote the recycling of gold from existing products (e.g., electronics, jewelry) to reduce the need for new extraction. This can be factored into the overall supply and demand equation.

4. **Transparent Reporting and Monitoring**:
   - **Data Collection**: Implement a system for tracking gold extraction, usage, and recycling rates. This data can inform decisions about future extraction and allocation.
   - **Public Reporting**: Ensure transparency by publicly reporting on gold extraction and its uses, allowing stakeholders to understand how resources are being allocated and managed.

5. **Community and Stakeholder Engagement**:
   - **Involve Local Communities**: Engage local communities and stakeholders in the decision-making process regarding resource extraction and allocation. This can help ensure that the needs and concerns of those most affected by mining activities are considered.
   - **Collaborative Management**: Foster collaboration among governments, businesses, and communities to develop sustainable practices and policies that benefit all parties.


Uses : Initially it is to be used in international transactions, nations can choose their conversion ratios to their local currencies based on the taxes to be leived on international transactions. A common portal for facilitating such transactions can be created. That will be an easy way to keep track of all duties leived. This will prevent sudden turmoils in economies that may arise due to uncertainity fear among traders with the introduction of HL framework.

       Later, as the understanding grows, fair data is available, this can be integrated directly as local currency as well by modifying the duty charts.

Types of HL : Based on climates and regions, we may get different values of HL for a given task. 
   - **Climate Adjustments**: Consider adjusting the HL value based on climate conditions (hot, cold, neutral) that affect the calories burned. For example:
     - **Hot Climates**: Higher calorie expenditure due to heat stress and hydration needs.
     - **Cold Climates**: Increased energy expenditure for warmth and physical activity.
     - **Neutral Climates**: Standard calorie expenditure for typical labor activities.

But, the average value is to be taken from regions with same sea height level and similar climate. This way, a country can have more fairer costing & pay standards.


Possible criticisms against this framework, as pointed out by blacky..


### Potential Criticisms of the HL Framework

1. **Complexity of Implementation**:
   - **Calculation Challenges**: Accurately measuring calories burned for various activities can be complex and may require extensive data collection and analysis. Variability in individual metabolism, physical condition, and work conditions can complicate standardization.
   - **Administrative Burden**: Implementing the HL framework may create additional administrative tasks for businesses and governments, potentially leading to resistance from stakeholders.

2. **Cultural Differences**:
   - **Value Perception**: Different cultures may have varying perceptions of labor value, work ethics, and resource management. The HL framework may not resonate universally, leading to challenges in adoption.
   - **Local Practices**: Some communities may have traditional practices that conflict with the standardized approach of the HL framework, making it difficult to integrate into existing systems.

3. **Economic Disparities**:
   - **Equity Issues**: The framework may inadvertently favor certain regions or industries over others, particularly if the data used to calculate HL is not representative of all labor contexts. This could exacerbate existing economic disparities.
   - **Market Dynamics**: The introduction of a universal currency based on HL may disrupt existing market dynamics, leading to unintended consequences in pricing and trade.

4. **Sustainability Concerns**:
   - **Resource Overexploitation**: While the framework aims to promote sustainability, there is a risk that the focus on HL could lead to overexploitation of resources if not managed carefully, particularly in regions with high demand for labor-intensive products.
   - **Environmental Impact**: The framework must ensure that the pursuit of efficiency and productivity does not come at the expense of environmental health, particularly in resource extraction.

5. **Resistance from Governments and Institutions**:
   - **Taxation and Regulation**: Governments may resist adopting the HL framework for international transactions due to concerns about losing tax revenue or regulatory control over local economies.
   - **Political Will**: The success of the HL framework may depend on political will and cooperation among nations, which can be challenging to achieve in a fragmented global landscape.

6. **Technological Dependence**:
   - **Digital Divide**: The reliance on technology for tracking and exchanging HL units may create barriers for regions with limited access to digital infrastructure, potentially excluding certain populations from participation.
   - **Data Privacy**: The collection and use of data for calculating HL may raise concerns about privacy and data security, particularly if sensitive information is involved.


And corresponding addressing of those concerns by me, and elaborated by blacky (actual reply can be read in chat files) : 

1. **Calculation Challenges**:
   - **Averages as Standards**: Using averages for different climates and physical conditions is a practical approach. By establishing standard calorie expenditures for various activities based on climate and other factors, you can create a more manageable system for calculating HL.

2. **Cultural Independence**:
   - **Focus on Calories Burned**: By centering the framework on calories burned, you create a universal metric that transcends cultural differences. This allows for a more objective assessment of labor value, making it easier to implement across diverse contexts.

3. **Economic Disparities**:
   - **Layered Approach**: Your idea of a layered approach to resource assessment (physical,educational, equipment, communication etc.) is insightful. This can help ensure that all necessary factors are considered in determining the HL required for specific tasks, leading to a more equitable evaluation of labor.

4. **Sustainability Concerns**:
   - **Scarcity Index**: The inclusion of a scarcity index is a strong mechanism for managing resource use and ensuring sustainability. It helps balance the demand for resources with their availability, promoting responsible consumption.

5. **Resistance from Governments and Institutions**:
   - **Tax Revenue and Control**: While there may be concerns about tax revenue, your focus on reducing unnecessary greed and promoting equitable transactions is commendable. The HL-Local Currency portal can provide a structured way to manage transactions while maintaining local economic stability.

6. **Technological Dependence**:
   - **Access to Resources**: Your aim to provide more access to resources through fair pricing is a positive aspect of the HL framework. It can help level the playing field for individuals and businesses that may have been previously disadvantaged. For data privacy issues, anonymous data collection can be done along with consents given to citizens for properly outlining the usage and analysis purpose.


### Implementation : 
   - Initially it can be checked with a group of <small nation, big nation> where small is in terms of land, people, resources all. Start with basic exchanges first then move on to multiple and complex layered exchanges.

   - Then do with <one big nation, multiple small nations> across globe. This will introduce shipping, import, export factors as well. 

   - After successful attempts, do with <big nation1, big nation2>. 
Slowly and gradually shift. After all nations are there in international transaction, now move for replacement of local currencies or alternate to local currencies by redefining tax and duty rules.

### Some Inspirational points : 
   - For those old citizens who are capable of bringing change, have good connections and resources to do so, try not to die by leaving behind such greedy systems.
   - Because current generations and upcoming ones are mostly devoid of ground activities and have traits of weak physicality, more anger and short temperdness, greedy priciples without any foothold on values & ethics, dependent on technology(i.e. someone else will do).
   - These type of people are seen as pitiful by strong ones. Leaving behind such defilement oriented system will only spoil them more and a global scale war is unavoidable.

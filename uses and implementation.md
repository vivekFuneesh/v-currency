### Uses :
   - Initially v-currency is to be used in international transactions, nations can choose their conversion ratios to their local currencies based on the taxes to be leived on international transactions and their own agendas.
   - A common portal for facilitating such transactions can be created. That will be an easy way to keep track of all duties leived.
   - This will prevent sudden turmoils in economies that may arise due to uncertainity fear among traders with the introduction of HL framework.
   - Later, as the understanding grows, fair data is available, this can be integrated directly as local currency as well by modifying the duty charts.


### Implementation : 
   - Initially it can be experimented between 2 villages of a nation, then with a group of <small nation, big nation>  and <small nation1, small nation2> where small is in terms of all of the land, people and resources. Start with basic exchanges first then move on to multiple and complex layered exchanges.

   - Then do with <one big nation, multiple small nations> across globe. This will introduce shipping, import, export factors as well. 

   - After successful attempts, do with <big nation1, big nation2>. 
Slowly and gradually shift. After all nations are there in international transaction, now move for replacement of local currencies or alternate to local currencies by redefining tax and duty rules.

### Disaster management: 
   - Have an international disaster fund, if a country goes through a natural disaster or any other kind of disaster then help it either by having its scarcity index value increased to uniformily distribute the hit to all nations or by tapping that emergency fund to uplift its citizens or both (though unlikely). 
   - Its because when you are using v-currency then you are not just exchanging goods and services rather you are exchanging physical and mental hard work done by various communities. Similar steps within a nation, once v-currency is embedded within local.
